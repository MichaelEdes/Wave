This is the IOS project i created for my final year dissertation, "The use of wearable technology and a mobile application to aid in the monitoring of overall health with emphasis on mental and physiological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic".

The reasoning behind this was because I could see a common theme emerging between those who experienced long periods of isolation and lockdown and declining mental health, the restrictions imposed only exacerbated these issues meaning many did not get to experience physical activity and mental stimulation as they normally would through many outdoor and social activities.

In order to help address these issues I beleived that it would help to monitor and track your mental and physical state to avoid a decline in overall health, my research found that there was a significant correlation in covid-19 restrictions and an increase in mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, consequently lowering quality of life and physical health, because of this, I chose to emphasise the app more around physioligical triggers and its relationship with mental and physical states, e.g. anxiety and a rapid heart rate (hr >120bpm, provided by the heart rate sensor in the users wearable health device). Along with establishing relationships between triggers and physiological responses, I aimed to educate users to allow them to make better and more informed lifestyle choices that benefit their overall quality of life.
